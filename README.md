## HI welcome to TltOs !! 

TltOs, better known as "TiltOs", is an idea that,
I, The Linux Tube have been asked to do.
I've had many channel Subscribers ask me
to create a Linux Distro. Since I review 
so many, they feel I must know how to make
a good one !! 

Well this is my first attempt at this hopefully 
it will fit the bill !! So stay tuned here we GO !!


TiltOs will be based off of Arch, my second favorite 
Distro... It's geared at being minimal, so you
the end user can "Tilt" the Os the way you want it !!

So that means "Tilt" will have no cruft and
no mess....simple and clean but beautiful !! all in one !!!
